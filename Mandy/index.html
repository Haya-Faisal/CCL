                <p>Mandy does not have any immediate family, however somewhere in other puddles there might be some creatures that

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Mandy's body is made out of circles, with its head being the largest circle of diameter 10 and its tail being a
                    very small circle with diameter 2. Since it is always moving in its habitat, it looks like a circle with
                    diameters ranging between 2-10 appearing and disappearing.</p>

                Mandy is a very mysterious creature and has just been found. It is also a very introverted, shy creature, with a very small lifespan when it is without a puddle. All we know about Mandy is that 
                it lives in a puddle.It's puddle can dry up due to rising temperatures. If it is without a puddle it needs to be fed food or needs to be bought to a new puddle. If it is not fed food or is without 
                a puddle for 2 mins, it will die.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> When Mandy loses its puddle, please feed him food or drag the water droplet to it. If Mandy is not fed food for 30 seconds or is without 
                a puddle for 2 mins, it will die.
